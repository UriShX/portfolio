# Portfolio
### Complements my nicer looking portfolio on [my website](https://urishx.com/en/portfolio)
Following are links to projects I've been involved with in the past few years.
Some projects have proper documentation @ [Hackaday.io/urish](https://hackaday.io/urish), some are simply code snippets with
either a Fritzing image or a more complete schematic drawn in KiCad.

## Web Bluetooth control of servo and LED
A simple web app and a couple of gists, demonstrating a simple way to control ESP32 over BLE, using custom descriptors and a web based controller.
[App](https://github.com/UriShX/ESP32_fader)
['Breathing' LED gist](https://gist.github.com/UriShX/2b1f1c7b461b466a4b4ae336d52653dd)
[Hobby servo gist](https://gist.github.com/UriShX/81266ab108876c4ef4252cc9fd3e1432)

## Arduino MIDI controllers system
I dubbed this ['Arduino Blocks for MIDI Controllers'](https://hackaday.io/project/109296-arduino-blocks-for-midi-controllers), or
'AB4MC'. It was meant to be a system of shields connecting to the Arduino Uno, and allowing for Scratch- style programming. 
Hardware repository is [here](https://github.com/UriShX/AB4MIDICtrlrs), and two gists to display the system capabilities are: [8*8 button matrix](https://gist.github.com/UriShX/ac12b4dfd76a2afa1785bcdb08027061)
 and [4*16 analog input](https://gist.github.com/UriShX/a0cf2a0e9770fb016faa0da292c08822)

## 2 DC motors moving in tandem w/ AP for control and monitoring
ESP32 & Roboclaw control for exhibition in museum [code](https://github.com/UriShX/portfolio/Roboclaw_control_over_ESP32_with_AP_for_control/roboclaw_esp32_w_AP_and_config.ino)

## Raspberry Pi play video when button pressed
Written for a commercial exhibition, video plays when a user inserts a 'coin' to a slot in the enclosure. [code](https://github.com/UriShX/portfolio/Raspberry_Pi_play_video_with_GPIO/rPi_play_video_w_GPIO.py)

## NiTi light
Electrical realization of a table light design by Aya Shani. Code lives [here](https://github.com/UriShX/portfolio/NiTi_light/NiTi_heating_3_wires_with_LED_pot_switch_fan_cycling_button.ino).
